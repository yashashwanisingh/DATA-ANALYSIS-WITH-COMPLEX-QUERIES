This task focuses on performing advanced data analysis using SQL to extract meaningful insights from a dataset. The work involves using three key SQL techniques:

1. Window Functions

Used for operations like ranking, running totals, moving averages, and comparing rows within partitions.

2. Subqueries

Applied for nested data filtering, conditional calculations, and complex selections that depend on other query results.

3. Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

Used to break down complicated logic into clearer, step-by-step query blocks for better readability and organization.

What This Task Includes

SQL queries using window functions, subqueries, and CTEs

Output tables generated from each query

Short explanations describing trends or patterns observed in the results

Deliverable

A structured report containing:

The SQL queries

Their respective outputs

Brief insights based on the results

This task demonstrates the use of advanced SQL techniques for practical data analysis.
